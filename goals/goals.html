                A programmer is the person who develops computer programs, that is, writes, debugges and maintains the source code of a computer program, which executes the hardware of a computer, to perform a specific task.

                Programmers are also called software developers, although they are strictly part of a team of people from different specialties (mostly computer science), and the team itself is the developer.

                Programming is one of the main disciplines within computer science.

                In many countries, a programmer is also a recognized professional category.

                Physics is a science that is only developed by those people who are dedicated to research. However, physics has a large number of technical applications in the real world, making physics graduates or graduates one of the professionals with the lowest unemployment rate.
                Due to his deep training in all branches of physics (mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, electromagnetism, solid state physics, quantum physics, electrodynamics) and also in mathematics (algebra, real and complex mathematical analysis, statistics, ...) Physicists generally have good technical problem solving and analysis skills. Therefore, it is not surprising that physicists today are dedicated to: energy production, meteorology and the environment, new materials, optics (for example: development of invisible materials, 3D displays), biophysics and physics of Medicine (X-rays, MRI, new drugs), computer science and simulation, econophysics, or use of the tools of Physics applied to the economy to try to predict the movements of the economy.

                Finance is a branch of administration and economics that studies the exchange of capital between individuals, companies, or States and with the uncertainty and risk that these activities entail. It is dedicated to the study of obtaining capital for investment in productive assets and the investment decisions of savers.

                Likewise, its study is based on obtaining and managing money to achieve its respective objectives, taking into account all the risks that it implies, based on each and every one of its components to maintain good control.

                Finance studies how economic agents (companies, families or the State) must make investment, saving and spending decisions under conditions of uncertainty. When making these decisions, agents can choose different types of financial resources such as: money, bonds, shares or derivatives, including the purchase of capital goods such as machinery, buildings and other infrastructures. See difference between saving and investment.

                A designer is a professional who practices the design profession. Such a professional may dedicate or specialize in a wide variety of objects or areas of design. Designers are development, in terms of the project, of an object, product, or concept.

                Designers work according to a design process that begins with the interpretation or detection of a problem or need and culminates with the production or construction of the solution to this problem. In this process intervene, among many others, skills that are related to the management and knowledge of science, design aids, technology, psychology, form, ergonomics, language, visual communication, general culture and a great creative ability.

                Normally the exercise of the activity implies a professional contract between the designer and the client, which is usually a manufacturer or a company, although it can also be developed on its own and without a dependency relationship, both as a team and individually. In all cases, the practice entails great responsibility and mastery of the ethical implications of the exercise.
