                Stephen William Hawking, Oxford, January 8, 1942-Cambridge, March 14, 2018) 3 4 was a British theoretical physicist, astrophysicist, cosmologist and science popularizer. His most important works consisted of contributing, together with Roger Penrose, theorems regarding spacetime singularities in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes would emit radiation, 5 what is known today as radiation of Hawking (or sometimes Bekenstein-Hawking radiation). One of the main characteristics of his personality was his contribution to the scientific debate, sometimes publicly betting with other scientists. The best known case is his participation in the discussion about the conservation of information in black holes.

In developing the network, Zuckerberg had the support of his colleagues at Harvard University, the coordinator of computer science and his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.

                In April 2018, he was the youngest character to appear on Forbes magazine's list of billionaires, with a fortune valued at $ 73.2 billion, making him the eighth richest person in the world.

                the most famous scientist of the 20th century maintains his charisma and his legacy decades after his death. Born German, then nationalized Swiss and finally American, Albert Einstein left for posterity great theories, indelible phrases and what is surely the most popular equation in the history of science: E = mc2, the equivalence between mass and energy with speed of light squared a multiplication factor. Much to his regret, this formula cleared the way for the atomic bomb. Einstein, a convinced pacifist, always considered that having urged President Roosevelt to finance nuclear research was one of the mistakes of his life, even knowing that it was necessary to win the race against Germany. With physics as a starting point, his discoveries have left their mark in very diverse fields, and his predictions continue to be confirmed even today. The last one, gravitational waves. His popular icon status even led to him being offered the presidency of Israel, an honor he enthusiastically rejected.

                Satoshi Nakamoto (サ ト シ ・ ナ カ モ ト) is the pseudonym used by the person or group of people who created the Bitcoin protocol and its reference software. In 2008, Nakamoto posted an article12 on the metzdowd3 crypto mailing list that described a P2P digital money system. In 2009, he launched the Bitcoin software, creating the network of the same name and the first units of currency, called bitcoins.4 5

                Nakamoto collaborated with other programmers who joined the project until mid-2010. At that time, he cedes control of the source code repository and the network alert key to Gavin Andresen6, transferring domains related to prominent members of the Bitcoin community. and leaves the project.

                The transaction log shows that Nakamoto's known addresses contain approximately one million bitcoins.7 Nakamoto's true identity remains unknown and has been the subject of much speculation. It is not known if the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" is real or a pseudonym, or if the name represents a person or group of people.
